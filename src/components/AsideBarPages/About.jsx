        <br></br>
        <p>
          My name is Toma Gabriela Alexandra, I live in Bucharest and for the
          past two years, I've been focused on studying independently and I have
          enjoyed it wholeheartedly.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>How did it start?</h3>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          I got my bachelor's degree in kinesiology and worked as a physical
          therapist, providing treatments for many patients, including web
          developers - a good reminder to get up and stretch.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          As time went on, I began to feel stuck and I decided to explore
          programming, because it felt like the challenge I needed, as it was
          something very different from what I was accustomed to. And when I
          first dove into Javascript, I was anxious and excited and that is when
          the satisfaction from solving problems came - and it keeps coming.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Started with the cuties: <span>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Got a bit bullied, but conquered:{" "}
          <span>Bootstrap, jQuery, Git and React</span>.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          And now I am diving into the big boys:
          <span> NodeJS, Express.js and MongoDB</span>.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>
          Because I really want to be able to create anything that I can
          imagine.
        </h4>
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
